Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically.
The STATION table is described as follows:


> select CITY,LENGTH(CITY) from Station where LENGTH(CITY) = (select MIN(LENGTH(CITY)) from STATION) order by CITY LIMIT 1;

> select CITY,LENGTH(CITY) from STATION where LENGTH(CITY) = (select MAX(LENGTH(CITY)) from STATION) order by CITY LIMIT 1;
 -----------------------------------

FINDING CITY WITH STARTING VOVELS

> select DISTINCT CITY from STATION where CITY LIKE 'a%' OR CITY LIKE 'e%' OR CITY LIKE 'i%' OR CITY LIKE 'O%' OR CITY LIKE 'U%';

-----------------
vovels start and at end

> SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(CITY, '^[aeiou].*[aeiou]$')

> SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE LOWER(LEFT(CITY,1)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u') AND LOWER(RIGHT(CITY,1)) IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

> select distinct(city) from station where left(lower(city),1) in ('a','e','i','o','u') and right(lower(city),1) in ('a','e','i','o','u');

-----------------

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

> select DISTINCT city FROM station where LOWER(LEFT(CITY,1)) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');

-----------------

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

> select DISTINCT city from station where LOWER(RIGHT(CITY,1)) NOT IN ('a','e','i','o','u');
